#+title: Calibration simulation study

This repository provides code to run a simulation study to test out
the performance of the [[https://aezarebski.github.io/timtam/][TimTam]] approximation, described in [[https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009805][Zarebski /et al/ (2022)]].
This document has the following sections:

- [[#sec:sim-study][Simulation study]] describes the parameters used in the simulation
- [[#sec:results][Results]] presents the main figures produced
- [[#sec:running][Running]] describes how to run the code in this repository

| Parameter     | Description            |  Value |
|---------------+------------------------+--------|
|               | Duration               |     56 |
| \(\lambda_1\) | Birth rate 1           |  0.185 |
| \(\lambda_2\) | Birth rate 2           | 0.0925 |
|               | Birth rate change time |     42 |
| \(\mu\)       | Death rate             |  0.046 |
| \(\psi\)      | Sampling rate          |  0.008 |
| \(\omega\)    | Occurrence rate        |  0.046 |

*** Analysis 1

Assuming birth-death model is correctly specified and only estimating
the rates.

*** Analysis 2

Assuming birth-death model is correctly specified and estimating both
the rates and the prevalence just after the last sample (at time
\(-0.01\)).

*** Analysis 3

Use the canonical parameterisation and estimate the prevalence just
after the last sample (at time \(-0.01\)), but aggregate the
occurrence data into daily counts.

The intervals calculated in the two summary tables are the /highest
posterior density/ (HPD) intervals. An earlier version of the code
used the equal tails interval; changing from equal tails to HPD made
only a small change to the sizes of the intervals.

* Running calibration study

This assumes that you have [[https://ant.apache.org/][Apache Ant]], [[https://cran.r-project.org/][R]] and [[https://www.java.com/en/][Java]] installed.

** Getting help

The computations are coordinated with Ant. To get a list of the
various /targets/ of the pipeline it knows how to build, run the
following command:

#+begin_src sh
  ant -p
#+end_src

** Setting up BEAST2

#+begin_src sh
  ant setuplib
#+end_src

Note that this will only set up the relevant BEAST tools. You will
still need to install the TimTam package via BEAUti.

** Running (and debugging) the study

#+begin_src sh
  ant scenario-3
#+end_src

The =scenario-3= target carries out the whole computation. This is
just a wrapper around the following sub-targets:

- =scenario-3-remaster= :: Runs the =remaster= simulation.
- =scenario-3-preprocess= :: Simulates the genetic data and constructs
  the BEAST XML for the MCMC.
- =scenario-3-mcmc= :: Runs the MCMC replicates in parallel across
  several batches.
- =scenario-3-postprocess= :: Post-processing of posterior samples and
  figure generation.

If you want to debug this at all, it is probably a good idea to try
and run these sub-targets in order. The output should appear in the
=out/s3= directory.

There is some configuration in the [[file:./build.xml][ant build script]] that you can
comment in and out to toggle between a large and a small simulation.
Running the small simulation is useful when trying to debug this
pipeline.
