#+title: Calibration study

This project carries out a calibration study on the =timtam= package for BEAST2.
Look at the code in =demo-b.R= for an example of how to use the code in this
project.

- Configuration A :: An example with constant rates making use of unscheduled
  sequence data and a time series of unsequenced data.
- Configuration B :: Is a smaller example based on *Configuration A* designed
  for testing purposes of the pipeline.
- Configuration C :: An example only using sequenced data for comparison with
  BDSKY.
